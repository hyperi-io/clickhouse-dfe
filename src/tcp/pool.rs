//! deadpool-managed connection pool for the TCP transport.
//!
//! Wraps [`crate::tcp::connection_actor::ConnectionHandle`] in a
//! [`deadpool::managed::Pool`] so callers can acquire ready-to-use
//! connections without having to drive the connect + handshake +
//! actor-spawn sequence themselves. `recycle` returns the handle when
//! it is alive (i.e. not poisoned by an I/O failure mid-command) and
//! drops it otherwise -- the next caller then sees a freshly
//! handshaken connection courtesy of `Manager::create`.
//!
//! # Recycle semantics
//!
//! [`ConnectionHandle::is_alive`] checks the poisoned flag only; it does
//! not probe the socket. The actor's reader sub-task poisons on any I/O
//! failure and the writer arms poison on any send failure, so a torn
//! connection is flagged before its channel ever closes.
//!
//! Refusing a connection shuts its actor down and waits, so the socket
//! and the reader sub-task are gone before the slot refills. That wait
//! is what `recycle_timeout` bounds.
//!
//! Timeout configuration requires deadpool's `Runtime` to be set, which
//! is why [`build_pool`] threads `Runtime::Tokio1` through.
