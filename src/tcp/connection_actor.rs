//! Background-task socket-state owner for ClickHouse TCP connections.
//!
//! Built on the generic `crate::worker::CommandWorker` primitive. The
//! actor owns the writer half of a [`MaybeTlsStream`]; an independent
//! reader sub-task owns the read half and forwards every decoded server
//! packet through a bounded mpsc channel, so the read loop keeps running
//! while a write command is in flight.
//!
//! # Why an actor instead of borrowed I/O
//!
//! Holding `&mut Connection` across the two halves for the duration of a
//! query is structurally cancellation-unsafe: any `tokio::select!`,
//! `tokio::time::timeout` or caller disconnect that drops the future
//! mid-`read_packet()` leaves the socket in an unknown state, and the
//! only recovery is tearing the connection down. Owning the I/O inside a
//! long-lived task means a dropped caller future never disturbs the
//! wire; the actor observes the reply channel closing and reacts at
//! protocol level (Cancel packet, bounded drain, return to pool).
//!
//! Three capabilities only this shape unlocks:
//!
//! 1. Protocol-level Cancel during an in-flight query -- the writer is
//!    free to send it because no caller holds it.
//! 2. Full-duplex Exception detection during INSERT -- the reader
//!    sub-task surfaces a server-side rejection before the next block
//!    goes on the wire.
//! 3. Idle keepalive -- Ping between commands without racing a caller
//!    for the writer.

//! `tokio::io::split` returns are `Send + 'static` whenever the stream
