# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. By contributing, you agree to the
terms outlined below.

## Stay close to upstream

This crate extends the official ClickHouse Rust client and expects code to
travel back and forth with it. Keep files upstream-shaped: same edition, same
MSRV (`rust-toolchain.toml`), same `rustfmt.toml`, same lint set. A file that
needs a reformat before it can be cherry-picked has already cost more than it
saved.

The dependency on `clickhouse` is a published crates.io release, and only ever
that. No `git =`, no `path =`, no `[patch.crates-io]`.

## Commit Message Format

HyperI projects use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
and [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated
versioning and changelog generation. All commits must follow this format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | A new feature | Minor (0.X.0) |
| `fix` | A bug fix | Patch (0.0.X) |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.) | None |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | None |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Patch (0.0.X) |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | None |
| `build` | Changes to build system or dependencies | None |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration | None |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files | None |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit | Varies |

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes that require a major version bump, add `!` after the type
or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```text
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/users endpoint has been removed. Use /v2/users instead.
```

### Scope

Scope is optional but recommended. Use the layer the change lands in: `tcp`,
`tls`, `native`, `dynamic`, `unified`, `ext`, `inserter`.

## Semantic Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes that require users to modify their code
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features that are backwards-compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and minor improvements

Versions are automatically determined by semantic-release based on commit
messages. Do not manually update version numbers.

While the crate is pre-1.0 the API is unstable, and a minor bump can carry a
breaking change.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that
contributors have the right to submit their contributions.

By making a contribution to this project, you certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by you and you have the
   right to submit it under the license indicated in the file; or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of your
   knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and you
   have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications;
   or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
   certified (1), (2) or (3) and you have not modified it.

4. You understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public
   and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information
   you submit with it, including your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely
   and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the license(s)
   involved.

## How to Sign Off Your Commits

You must sign off each commit to indicate your acceptance of the DCO. Combine
the signoff with your conventional commit message:

```bash
git commit --signoff -m "feat(tcp): add connection-level query timeout"
```

Make sure your Git configuration has your correct name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Feature layers

Every layer of this crate is behind a Cargo feature, so a change that only
compiles with the default set is a broken change. Check both ends of the
matrix before you push:

```bash
make check-features
```

## Run the checks locally before you push

HyperI projects gate every push through CI (lint, format, tests, secret scan,
dependency audit, build). Run the SAME checks locally first so your change lands
green instead of bouncing:

```bash
hyperi-ci check
```

`hyperi-ci` is the HyperI CI CLI (public on PyPI). If you do not have it, install
it once with `uv tool install hyperi-ci` (or `pipx install hyperi-ci`), or run it
ad hoc with `uvx hyperi-ci check`. It runs the project's full local validation --
the same suite CI runs -- and reports what to fix. Run it before every push and
before opening a pull request; it is the single best way to give your change the
best chance of surviving CI.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the commit message format above
3. **Sign off your commits** with the DCO
4. **Test your changes** to ensure they work as expected
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you've done

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Commits follow the conventional commit format
- [ ] All commits are signed off (DCO)
- [ ] `make check-features` passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if applicable)

## CI/CD Workflow

When your pull request is merged to `main`:

1. **semantic-release** analyses commit messages since the last release
2. Determines the next version number based on commit types
3. Generates/updates the CHANGELOG
4. Creates a new GitHub release with release notes
5. Publishes the crate to crates.io

This happens automatically - no manual intervention required.
